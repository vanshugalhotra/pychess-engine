    Represents a chess move with encoded properties like source square, destination square, captured piece, promotion,

    Class Variables:
        NOMOVE (MOVE): A static variable representing a non-existent or invalid move.
        FLAG_EP (int): Flag for en passant captures.
        FLAG_PS (int): Flag for pawn start moves.
        FLAG_CA (int): Flag for castling moves.
        FLAG_CAP (int): Flag for capture moves.
        FLAG_PROM (int): Flag for pawn promotion moves.

    Attributes:
        move (int): Encoded move information in 25 bits (source, destination, captured piece, promotion, flags).
        score (int): move score for evaluation purposes.

    Methods:
        FROMSQ(): Extracts and returns the source square of the move.
        TOSQ(): Extracts and returns the destination square of the move.
        CAPTURED(): Extracts and returns the captured piece code, if any.
        PROMOTED(): Extracts and returns the promotion piece code, if any.
        alpha_move() -> str: Converts the move to an algebraic notation string.
        move_exists(board) -> bool: Checks if the move exists on a given board by generating possible moves.
